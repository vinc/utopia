Technology has advanced to the point where almost everything can be produced with ease and without the need for extensive resource extraction. This has led to the creation of societies that are based on principles of mutual aid, cooperation, and equality.</p>"

Some are organized around small-scale communities that are self-sufficient and rely on local resources. Others are organized around networks of larger communities that share resources and knowledge.</p>"
