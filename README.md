[ChatGPT][1] and [OpenJourney][2] were asked to halucinate for us a future from
the year 2300, two centuries after human population peaked, where half of the
land was set aside for nature and humans became steward of the land after
organizing themselves into post-scarcity anarchist communities.

## Prompts
